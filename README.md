This are community developer challenges given out to Andela Student Fellos by Andela Student Ambassadors in Multimedia University . 
The projects are a follow up on the weekly study tests that are done. 
Feel free to contribute to the repository and have fun while coding.

**Week One Challenges**

        **_CHALLENGE ONE (PYTHON SYNTAX)_**
1.	First, let's declare the variable meal and assign it the value 44.50.
2.	
Create the variable tax and set it equal to the decimal value of 6.75%.
3.	
Set the variable tip to decimal value of 15% 
4.	reassign meal to the value of itself + itself * tax. (And yes, you're allowed to reassign a variable in terms of itself!)
5.	Assign the variable total to the sum of meal + meal * tip . 

Now you should have be able the total cost of your meal! 

        **_CHALLENGE TWO (Area Calculator)_**
        
Create a Program that does the following: 
1.	Prompt the user to select a shape
2.	Depending on the shape the user selects, calculate the area of that shape
3.	Print the area of that shape to the user.
4.	Verify all errors including users inputting uppercase letters or single letters of the shapes (e.g “C” instead of “circle”: or “RECTANGLE” instead of “rectangle”).  
NB: the shapes should be a Circle, A rectangle and a Triangle

        _**CHALLENGE THREE (PYGLATIN)**_
        
Pig Latin is a language game, where you move the first letter of the word to the end and add "ay." So "Python" becomes "ythonpay.", “Egg” becomes “ggeay” To write a Pig Latin translator in Python, here are the steps we'll need to take:
1.	Ask the user to input a word in English.
2.	Make sure the user entered a valid word (check if the word has characters and is not blank).
3.	Convert the word from English to Pig Latin (moves first letter to the end and add ay).
4.	Display the translation result (print the output of word after translation).
Best of all challenges 
